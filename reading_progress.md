I finally get a whole set of [Gateway to the Great Books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_to_the_Great_Books) (GGB) (10 Volume set) and the [Britannica Great Books of the Western World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Books_of_the_Western_World#Second_edition) (GBWW) (1993 version, 60 Volume set). I decide to go through these books in the next couple of years (10? 15? or 20?). First finish GGB to practice my English reading, and then GBWW. I found there are some great reading plans online to guide you through these books, and one of them I really like is from the website of [The Western Tradition](https://westerntradition.wordpress.com/great-books-project/great-books-project-post-index/), though it later starts to add the GBWW pretty early to keep the speed to finish everything within 7 years. I prefer to finish the GGB first before entering into the GBWW series. So I decide to make my own plan. 

To finish the GGB, the total pages of this 10 vol set is 5046 pages, so the plan is to read about 100 pages per week that distributed in the different types of books, which I can roughly finish around 1 year (if nothing stop me). From the two sets of the books, they have the following categories. 

 GGB
 * Imaginative Vol 2 - 5
 * Man and Society Vol 6 - 7
 * Science and Math Vol 8 - 9 
 * Philosophy Vol 10
