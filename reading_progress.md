I finally get a whole set of Gateway to the Great Books (GGB) (10 Volume set) and the Britannica Great Books of the Western World (GBWW) (1993 version, 60 Volume set). I decide to go through these books in the next couple of years (10? 15? or 20?). I found there are some great reading plans online to guide you through these books, and one of them I really like is from the website of [The Western Tradition](https://westerntradition.wordpress.com/great-books-project/great-books-project-post-index/), though it didn't finish the whole plan. I will start with this plan and see if I can finish the whole two sets. In the first pass, I think I will focus on reading and underlining/notes on the margin instead of summary, this way can at least help to keep the speed.
