## About me:  

I am currently a research scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Before I joined the lab, I was an Assistant Researcher at [Berkeley Seismology Lab](http://seismo.berkeley.edu/) working between Earth Science and Data Science. I was also a visiting researcher in the visiting faculty program at Google, Mountain View, to help build the [Android Earthquake Alerting System](https://blog.google/products/android/earthquake-detection-and-alerts).  

My research lies at the intersection of seismology, civil engineering and data science. My research contributions are mostly in the domain of earthquake early warning and machine learning: I have been to create the smartphone seismic network to monitor earthquake hazards using crowdsourcing and low-cost sensor network in urban environment, and to leverage machine learning and data science tools in different areas.
