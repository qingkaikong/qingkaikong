**On Being the Right Size**

This is a pretty good essay on thinkings about the sizes of the natural or social things. I really like it, it thinks the sizes are optimized by nature during the evolution, such as that if you change the size of an animal for example, you have to change the form as well. There are many good examples why certain animals or platns have certain sizes, some of them I never know, such as the small insects relying on diffusion of the O2 in their body, thus they never become so large, otherwise, they have to use blood/fluid to carry it to the other parts of the body. I also think the analogy of the human society is also interesting, and that why in the past the Greek's city-state is popular, because it limited by the size. The invention of the house representatives changed this in UK, to have larger nations. The socialim will have a limitation as well. But I think, it is a little different if you only draw conclusions from the nature, because as the author pointed out, the human can make inventions that not in nature to really change the situation. Thus, we made a lot of things that beyond nature.

**Preface to Leaves of Grass**

The Leaves of Grass is so famous that I was planning to read sometime in the future. I thought it would be interesting to read the preface first, but I found it is not that easy to really understand everything. I got a feeling that Whitman is a little arrogant on the US things are better. Of course, this book is the one that represent the nationality proud of US, for sure, it should contain that feeling. But also interesting is his life and how he writes this book. How could he be so confident and sell his house in order to publish this book, and publish many editions, even it has not been sold well. The freedom (freestyle) in the book is a representation of the US spirit.

**Sketch of Abraham Lincoln** and **Death of Abraham Lincoln**

A nice sketch of Abraham Lincoln, and it gives me the impression that he is a very kind and nice person, and a little too warm from my point of view. 

The death of Abraham Lincoln is a good one to take us back to the April 14th 1865. I suddenlly realize that I am readingn this piece on April 14th 2023, which is exactly 158 years later. What a chance! Anyway, the view of the whole murder is very clear from the telling, and we can see the last few minutes of the Lincoln's life, and how the people later got into chaos. I found I had a very interesting feeling that, if he was staying at home reading books, this tragedy maybe will be avoided. But how important one person in the history? If he didn't die, what things can happen.

**Two Friends** and **The Killers**

I am shocked by the end of the "Two Friends", who can think of people lost their lives due to just go fishing, of course, during the war. This story tells us what happened when the Prussian army surrounded the French city. People are lacking of food, and have very low moral. The two friends, not so close, but good enough to really think to have a change, go fishing near the river. But unfortunately, they were caught by the Prussian soldiers, and got shot in the end. How ridiculous this is! But I guess during the war, these kind of things happen a lot, and many people lose their lives for no reasons. Better have no wars!  
 
The killers is a good one that gives us a view of a situation that the killers tries to kill someone. By seeing their funny conversations, as well as the uncertain behaviors, all these will increase your anxiety about them. It also makes you wonder if something will happen to Nick when he tries to go to notify the fighter. It is interesting to see that Nick is the only one willing to change after the incidence, and he decides this is not the life he wants, and he is planning to move to another city. All the others have give up the hope and get used to this type of things. In this sense, Nick should be the main character in the story, since he has growth from the beginning to end.

**What is War**

I read this in Chinese before, though not finish the whole book. I was thinking this one will be interesting, but it is actually not that interesting anymore to me. War is the extension of the politics, and the discussions of the nature makes me feel that, it will never be a topic that we can study use science. Because the war contains so much emotion and irrational things that can not be formulated using the theories.

**On the Feeling of Immortality in Youth**

A short essay mostly talking about the youth never need to worry about the death, aging etc. It is reminds me of when I was young, I seldom thought about these things. Mostly I was experiencing the world in my own pace. I now always think the best thing I did when I was young was being a little bad instead of the good kid in the adult's eyes. Because I freely did what I wanted to do, which many of them I would not dare to do anymore. This is the good thing about being youth, you can really try to do things you want, and test/try different flavors of life.
