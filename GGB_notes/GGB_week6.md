**On Mathematical Method**

From the initial abstraction, to the variables and graphs used in math, and to the application to real world phenomenons, mathematical method shows great potential when it is combined with physics. The core idea of this abstraction, as well as the tools developed are unique from man, and really took off in the last few hundred years.

**What is a classic**

What is a classic? This is a pretty difficult questions, since it involves finding a set of metrics to evaluate the past works. It is difficult not only on finding these metrics, but also they are changing with time, place and people. Still this essay gives some interesting points that worth considering. There are also some points struck me

* Homer, Plato and the authors in that period had no one to imitate and they are really free at the first place  
* It maybe easier to define the classics in science, mathematics which are involve with rationality, but not easy for works involve with sensibility. 
* The classics may be a reflection of strong culture, in the sense that, the western culture/civilization is dominating right now, thus there are more of these classics.

**Nature** 


2nd part of this essay is difficult, I feel I understand less than half of it. I need to re-read it sometime later. I should update this later when I understand more.

**Robinson Crusoe**

Finish it, and there are some interesting things I was thinking:

* why on earth in the end he wants to go back? At this island, he is the king. 
* he lived on the island for more than 30 years, I am wondering what would it like if without the belief in God?
* this is more in novel, what it would like in reality?

**Learning the River**

My first time to read Mark Twain's writings in English, now I understand why everyone loves him. His writing style is very easy to read, and has many interesting things inside. Such as I learned the Mississipi river, I can see the interesting dynamics of the town when the steamboat comes, how eager the boys want to become a pilot, as well as his experiences of learning from the pilot. Very vivid, and makes you feel you are with him. I love learning the river by heart, and see many similarities of how to be an expert from this.

**Riders to the sea**

A play takes us to the lives on the Irish island. The women at home, and how do they deal with the loss of the men. I can feel the pain and the sadness of the women in the play, I also can feel the hardiness of life at that moment. At that moment, there are still lots of superstition, and people think the fate of a person depedents on many uncertain things.
