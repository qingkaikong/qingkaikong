**The Sacred Beatle**

I never thought I can learn so much from the dung beatles. This is a great essay writting about their behavior. Such as Egyptians worship the dung beatles, because their way represent the birth, death of the sun. Every day in the morning, the sun rises, while the dung beatles to make their balls, and then in the evening, they push the balls into underworld as the sun is down. The balls they make have empty centers that they can put their eggs in. When the baby beatles came out, and they can have fresh good meals. I also never thought of the robbery of the ball within the dung beatles, it seems everywhere in this world, and there are always folks don't want to work. But collaborations do between some of these beatles, the pull and push make a good couple. They are so cute now after reading this essay, and Fabre is a patient great observer. I'd like to read more of his essay. Also, I really like his way of life, as well as his atitude, something worth my learning.

What a imagination! I never thought that I will fell into Silt and observe all the different layers. It is an interesting going through time, and showing that our human is not in the center of the universe. We are the same as other animals.
