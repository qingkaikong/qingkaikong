**First Love**

Who hasn't have the sweetness and bitterness of the first love? This story shows that mixed feeling to us, so well that I feel I am in it to experience with it again. Though the princess mostly treat the love as game with a group of admirers, she eventually fell in love with the main character's father. This is a little odd to me, at least from today's point of view, that both father and son love the same woman. It is a wired relationship, but the first love feeling from the main character is real. I also read more of the life of Turgenev, and it seems this experience may based on his true experience (of course with some changes). I also never thought the princess will die in the end, I guess a price to pay for the game of love. Or to make the first love more sensible. Overall a good story.
