**The Darling**

Olenka is a good woman in traditional sense, that she is kind to everyone, and she devote all her love to the person she loves and even change to this person by herself. I don't like this type of life, that she loses her own identity. I think the person who she loves might be satisfied, but the boy seems overwhelmed by her love. I also saw a different take online, where thinks Olenka is a person really knows love, she casts her love to the person she loves, and lives a happy life by herself. I think this is also reasonable, if she feels happy, it is fine. Everyone is different, and we are all trying to find something that makes our life meaningful and worth living, she finds this way works for her.

**Dante**

This essay has some very interesting points that I never thought before. First, it thinks teh poetry of Dante is very easy to read, even you don't understand it, especially the Inferno. This is because Dante's language at that moment is closer to Latin, which is a more universal school of style due to the Europe is a big one country when they use Latin. So the main focus is to share the idea instead of having the individual cultures or customs from different countries. This is a pretty new point to me, I never thought about the influence of the big countries on the language, thus on the poetry. The 2nd point is that, Dante's Divine Comedy is an allegory, it has clear and precise images that very easy to understand. The 3rd point is that the Divine Comedy is a complete scale of the depths and heights of human emotions. Shakespeare gives the greatest width of human passion; Dante the greatest altitude and greatest depth. These are all very interesting points, I guess, this is enough motivation for me to read Divine Comedy soon.
