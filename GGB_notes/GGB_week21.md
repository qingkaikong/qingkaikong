**Great Documents**
This week is the July 4th week, and to learn more about some of the greatest documents in human history, I decided to read some of these documents that changed human society. I am really impressed by the things listed in these documents, some of them are about 250 years ago. They are so advanced, that even today, when I read it, I can still feel it is relavant. Especially I feel some countries even today have not totally understand or implement these human rights, or understand the meaning of freedom. I think these documents are worth reading, especially for the ones who live in a dictatorship country.
