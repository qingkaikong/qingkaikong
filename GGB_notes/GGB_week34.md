**The Philosophy of Common Sense**

Many interesting topics discussed here, and I actually like his view of the world of different things, such as the democracy from different animal species, Homer puts destiny above even Jupiter can not change it, Friendship is the marrige of souls (and this marriage is subject to divoce) etc. The one I really like is "Be content with what you have, desire nothing that is above your station, restrain your curiosity, curb your intellectual activity", these are excellent maxims, but if we had always followed them, we should still be eating acorns, we should still be sleeping in the open air. Another one is "I ask for money, not advice" when a passerby said to a beggar "Are you not ashamed to practice this infamous calling when you are able to work" and the beggar answered this. 

Since I am reading Greek Mythology recently, and really learned the names of the Greek Gods and the corresponding Roman Gods, I found in the topic of "Socrates", he was using the Roman Gods names, not sure if this is a mistake made by Voltaire.

**The Principle of Population**

I am amazed by this essay, written in 1798, that so many great ideas are discussed in it. The increasing rate of population is geometrical ratio while the food production rate is linear, though very rudimentary, it does capture some characteristics of it. There are many other factors discussed in this essay, by reviewing the existing societies, such as the Native Indians, the pasture and tillage, and mordern society such as England. In the end, it goes back to some basics of economics, which seems regulate this. Another interesting thing is that, at that moment, the spirit of independence is raising, which the government is not support it. I think this is still true these days, that the society and government is trying to make everyone dependent on society or inter-connected, otherwise, who will work? In another thought, if we can independent, we can achieve our freedom.
