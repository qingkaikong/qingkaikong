**The Moral Obligation to Be Intelligent**

This is written by the father of the great books movement, [John Erskine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Erskine_(educator)), who started the whole process of reading great books from the past and discussing it with groups at Columbia University. This essay is interesting, that he argues that the English tradition thinks the moral and intelligent are not compatible, and supported by many works he gave. 

I also think it is interesting that "when this emphasis upon the will became a social emphasis, it gave the direction of ethical feeling". This is so true, so many of these ethical feelings are from these social emphasis, and may not be good for us. 

I don't quite agree with what his reasons for this moral obligation (or maybe I didn't quite understand). What he gave are (1) because we believe it is life, and we believe it is the will of God (2) intelligence changes most fears into opportunity (3) Intelligence unites us with mankind. 

We had some discussions, and here are some interesting points:
* in the past, the class who rules the country dosen't want the lower classes to have intelligence, this is good for their control. 
* Bible is the educational material for a lot of people to learn which is also more emphasis on moral.

**Of Youth and Age**

A little difficult to read with the old style English, after the first pass, I read the Chinese version of this short essay, which helps a lot. I think I have familiarized the old English style by reading them side by side, which will make my future reading easier. 

I also think most of what he showed the difference between youth and aged man are easy to understand, and I've already known these from other readings before. Maybe this is because when he wrote this in his time, this is pretty much new but not now.

**How should one read a book**

Virginia's experience is interesting to read. I also learned that she is a pioneer in the use of stream of consciousness, when read she started to experiment with various methods of representing unspoken thoughts and feelings of her characters. 

I think she thinks reading as touring the houses, and learning the people/things inside and how they connected with other houses across space and time. She also thinks we shouldn't criticize before we read, which is good advice. The two processes of reading are good too.

**Mathematics, the Mirror of Civilization**

This is a great piece! I guess this is right within my area, so it is quite easy to read. But I really love the ideas within it, which I never thought before. 

It treats math as a language, more accurately, size language. The author raises the idea that if we don't understand it, we may have the risk of entering into a stage where only a small group of people controls it, and the rest only follow. The priest class in the past is a group of people like this. Though it is not exactly the same, I can see something similar that the AI developed these days, may have similar situation in the future. I also like the history and social influence on math that developed in this piece, which is usually missing from the math education. 

In the past, I never quite understand the Protestant tranformation, French revolution, and this piece is very clear on what they are and how they help bring down the authorities, which make us more value the freedom we got these days. 

The two way of viewing math, (1) Plato way, which it is the absolute truth, (2) language, it is only approximation to the truth. I now more prefer the 2nd way. 

My wife and I had a big discussion about the inclusion of math into the great books, and how value it is to include in mass education. What I think about math is:

* from the author, we need to understand it to avoid filled by the imagination of only a small clever people.   
* useful in our life for solving practical things, which is opposite to the philosophy, psychology etc, which is more study of ourselves. 
* The includes of these math/science books in the GB series are more teaching us the thinking process/way of the great thinkers, which is more important than the details. 
* I agree that we don't everyone to learn advanced math, but the basic science to teach them and movitate them is really important, especially let them know what they are useful for.   
* This point is more about reading the GB series. I feel, I, a student/researcher in science/technology, is more like a tool before if I only aquire the math or technical expertise. This series will make me more an independent thinking and know more about the inside-out of the different aspects of man (and its environment, society etc.).

**The Open Boat**

Nice story about an escape from a sank ship. The description is really vivid to give me a picture that I feel I am on the same small boat as them. There are many details that when you read you can start to sketch the whole picture such as the appearance and character of different folks on the boat. There are also good internal descripowtion about the folks (mostly the correspondent). Interesting to see how they feel during this live or death situation, and how it changes overtime. This really reminds me the movie "Gravity" and the book "The death of Ivan Ilytch". All gives you the experience before death (some escaped some not). 

The other thing struck me is when the author talks about the soldier lying down there wait to die. I think some day when I am close to death, I will think about these feelings and I guess only by then I can really experience this feeling.

**Childhood and Youth**

This is essentially what's the education for a genius at home. I am really impressed by Mill's education by his father. Though I don't like the sole focus on the education instead of other fun in life, such as play, physics exercise, social with others etc., I think there are something I can learn from this experience. I also remember an article I read that the author of the Great books after reading John Mill, decides to read the great books in human history, in a sense, you can think this experience really inspired the start of the Great books. 

Here is a simplified version what his learning path: he starts with languages (Greek) -> Tales/Mysteries -> Histories -> Classics -> Math -> Play/Poetry -> Experimental Science -> Logic -> More Philosophy. Kind of from concrete things to more abstract and thoughts path. What is missing here mostly is the literatures (of fictions), I was thinking, if fictions are imagination of one person (mostly the author), can we say history is the product of the imagination of the human being as a whole? I think it has its value in kid's development, which I will start to add to my kids' study schedule. 

Something I learned from his father's method:

* discuss with the learnings from your kids is a very good approach to learn what they learned, and to give them your perspective    
* even the thing you talked to your kids may not totally understandable by them, it is more like plant a seed in them, and at a later stage may grow when they are ready    
* don't encourage any memory of facts, instead, let them to try first, and if they can not get it, we can offer help, but let them try first  
* logic is also very important for them to form independent thinker
