**Of the Standard of Taste**

Hume is trying to find a standard that we can use to regulate our taste, which has great variety in our society. 

* Determinations of understanding has a reference beyond themselves, there is only one just and truth. While sentiment had a reference to nothing beyond itself, and is always real wherever a man is conscious of it. 
* I also like this "A good palate is not tried by strong flavours, but by a mixture of small ingredients, where we are still sensible of each part, notwithstanding its minuteness and its confusion"
* strong sense, united to delicate sentiment, improved by practice, perfected by comparison, and cleared of all prejudice, can alone entitle critics to this valuable character; and the joint verdict of such, wherever they are to be found, is the true standard of taste and beauty.

**The March to the Sea**

I really like this one, now I am planning to buy the whole book of Anabasis to learn more. The writting is pretty good that, I feel I am with Xenophon for the retreat in deep enemy territory. The way they decide to retreat, at the village that only get what they need for food to avoid ignite the anger of the local people, the fight in the narrow pass, the clever strategy to cross the river, the treatment of the prisoners, the hardness of across the snow, and so on is so vivid, that really make me immersed in the adventure. What an adventure that I joined! One thing from reading is that, human beings doesn't change too much, and if you ignore the weapons they are using, we are still the same human being as they are, the human nature, the loveness, the courage, the deceit, and so on didn't change too much. One purticular thing I am impressed that, the millitary leaders in that time have so many knowledge, that they can write the history, they can write poetry, they can have philosophical thinking instead of only capable of fighting. Also, Xenophon records down so many of names for ordinary soldiers, which is usually something missing in other works. When they finally see the promissed ocean, I actually feel their emotion at that time, how wonderful to see home after a long risky adventure!

**Of Money** 

The discussion in this essay is not what I thought. I was thinking more on the nature of the money and how it affect individuals. But this essay mostly talking about the money on the nation/state scale. Two points mostly across the whole essay. The first one is lots of money pouring into one nation, maybe is not a big advantage within the country, because the more money you have, the higher the price of the commodities. Though there is a lag time that within that, having more money will have better advantage, it eventually back to normal after all the fields catch up. I think the international connections are different today, and having more money definitely is different than that time, such as US, we can see how advantage it is. The second point I think is also very interesting, he thinks that, within a country, it is good to encourage refined life than simple life. Because the latter will cause the country poor, and less tax can be collected, but the former is a better mode that you can collect more tax. I think this is also due to the time, that at the beginning of the industrial revolution, encourage people to have refined life, can improve the overal economy. But today, things are different, I think encourage people to do more creative things that they want to do is more important to encourage them to buy more luxury stuff. But overall, it is an interesting essay.

**The Starry Messenger**

We all know Galileo is the first one pointed the telescope (spy scope at that moment) and observed the moon and also found the 4 satellites around Jupiter. But reading what he first recorded down really gives me a feeling that I am with him at the first time in human history to observe the mighty heaven! I am also impressed by how detail he made for the surface of the moon, and spent months to observe it. I also remember my observation with the moon using telescope, usually, not too long, I will move to other objects. One thing is that, I lose all the excitement due to all the images online, that I saw better ones. The other thing is that, I don't have the patience or the time to really observe hours for a few months. I am so impatient today, that in one night, I usually try to observe as many objects as I can.

**Of Friendship** and **Of Anger**

Of Friendship has many example stories that I don't know, which really affect my understanding ...

**The Happy Prince**

A short interesting fairy tale, makes you think, though I think it is mostly a religious tale to teach people doing good things. Some thinkings I had while reading this tale are:

* when we raise the kids, it is not good at all to only show good things to them, eventually, they will exposed to see the bad ugly things in this world.  
* doing good things to others can warm you, and can also transfer this feeling to others, such as the swallow in the story. He even give up his life in the end to accompany with the prince! 
* why there are so many poor, unfortunate people in the story, why only the prince is trying to help them? why there are people who accomulated all the wealth and fame and ignored all these? why the poor not stand up and only wait for help? Help from the rich may not be the final solution of an equal and well society
* when we help others, how many people can help others with full of their power like the little prince? I know, I can not.
