**The Misanthrope**

An interesting play that a person hates everything falls in love with a lady who is one that only interested in ranking or money in terms of marriage. I love his thinking of live away from the society, and that could be a very nice state. This play also shows us the hypocrisies in 17th-century French aristocratic society, something similar to the scandle schools I read before. This makes the conflict between individual and society more interesting in this sense.

**Sweetness and Light**

This essay is not an easy read. We need to learn the general background of the society by then. It is the time when the England is moving fast forward with the industrial revolution, and the machinary changed everything. It tries to find out the real ground for culture. Wealth, machinery, utilitarianism all not working. He thinks the religion is one of the most useeful thing invented to improve our human being internals. We should seak for a combination of both internal and external states, that can help us grow both. This is what he thinks about the best: the great men of culture are those who have had a passion for diffusing, for making prevail, for carrying from one end of society to the other, the best knowledge, the best ideas of their time; who have laboured to divest knowledge of all that was harsh, uncouth, difficult, abstract, professional, exclusive; to humanize it, to make it efficient outside the clique of the cultivated and learned, yet still remaining the best knowledge and thought of the time, and a true source, therefore, of sweetness and light.

**On Style**

One key point repeat again and again in this piece is that, ideas are more important than any style in terms of writing. I am also impressed by his direct criticism to some of the important figures in that time, so bold. 

* Style is the physiognomy of the mind, and a safer index to character than the face. To imitate another man's style is like wearing a mask.   
* Wisdom is the beginning and source of good writing.  
* Simplicity has always been held to be a mark of truth; it is also a mark of genius.   
* a good styleis that the author should have something to say.  
* Good writing should be govened by the rule that a man can think only one thing clearly at a time.

**On Some Forms of Literature**

This is an even more agressive piece, he thinks drama is the most perfect reflection of human existence, because (1) it is never anything more than merely interesting, (2) it is sentimental, (3) the tragic climax  can show the vanity  of all human effort.  

He also thinks the great novel is not to relate great events, but to make small ones interesting. 

While the most interesting part is what he thinks about history: History has always been the favorite study of those who wish to learn something without having to face the effort demanded by any branch of real knowledge, which taxes the inteligence. What a statement ^_^ There are two kinds of history, policts and literature and art, the second is much more interesting. 

The newspaper is the second hand in the clock of history, though he thinks exaggeration is everywhere that we need to be careful when reading newspaper. 

I also like these sentences "As regards reading, to require that a man shall retain everything he has ever read is  like asking him to carry about with him all he has ever eaten". "Repetition is the mother of learning".

**On the Comparative Place of Interest and Beauty in Works of Art**

I actually never thought this kind of question before, the interest in works of art, what is the relationship to the beauty of the works. Is the interest of a work of art is a second end, or just a means to the exhibition of its beauty; or whether the interest of it is produced by its beauty as an essential concomitant, and comes of itself as soon as it is beautiful; or whether itnterest is at any rate compatible with the main end of art; or finally whether it is a hindrance to it. This small piece answered these questions, and showed how the interest is compatible with beauty.
