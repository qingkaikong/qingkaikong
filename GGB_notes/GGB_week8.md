**The Discovery of Radium**

This is such a great selection from the Madame Curie that makes me really want to read the whole book, which I will buy and read it. 

A couple of things really struck me

* She did a really careful thinking and researching what to do for her PhD thesis. Anyone who did research will know that how important the selection of the direction to go, but many times, we don't think carefully about it until pretty late. This is the same thing for many things in our life, we really need to think over carefully before we make the direction, since with a wrong direction, the harder you work, the further away you are from the correct goal. So, don't be lazy about thinking for yourself. 

* when she thinks she find some new element, and all other people initially didn't believe it. But she did really careful check and confident in her own judgement. I think this what we should all have once you confirm it by yourself. 

* I also really like the fact that, Madame Curie, who won 2 Nobel Prizes, live a simple life, even Einstein said she is the only one that not corrupted by the reputation. I hope I can do something like that in the future. 

* She must be a very careful person, since she even take notes of her daughter's weight and how many teeth she has.

**The Study of Poetry**

The study of poetry is important, and without it, the science is not complete, because it deals with the emotion which science never concern (or there is no way to do that). This essay also tries to teach us how to identify classic poetry, from Substances and Seriousness. I can understand the first one but not the latter one. It also gives some examples, but my level is still not enough to really get it. I also love it goes through some history of the development of the poetry from the 12th century French romantic poetry, to the 14th century Chaucerï¼Œto the 18th century. The time when the author write this essay is the time when the Industrial revolution brings the middle classes into wealthy and powerful stage, but he thinks they need to improve their literature and poetry as well.

**The Making of Americans** 

This is an interesting selection to talk about the features of Americans almost at the time when it is newly founded. I agree that men are like plants, the goodness and flavor of the fruit proceeds from the peculiar soil and exposition in which they grow. Lots of these featuers of Americans are from this land. This selection talks about the features of people on the coast, middle land and the ones close to the forest. From these, I think I love the ones close to the forest, the new makings of the indians ^_^ Another striking thing is that, at the time, no tax for people living on this land, no wonder they are happy. The income tax is a product of the 20th century thing, you can find more information on [WIKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_taxation_in_the_United_States). Now I am wondering, why do collect tax? Maybe I need to read some of these. There are also examples how the different people really mixed together into the Americans, such as the religions, interesting reading.

**The Battle with the Cannon**

An interesting story to show you an incident of the insecure of an Cannon on the ship caused chaos on it. Though the gunner man in the end successfully fixed the problem, the general decided to shot him. I didn't expect the end, but I think this maybe the reality in our world, it is cruel.

**Of Refinement in the Arts**

**The Enchiridion**

The Stoic handbook, this is my first reading of the original book from Stoic master. I know some of the teachings from Stoic from other books, and this one is really cool to give you specific advices for different things. It starts with the dividing of the things that internally and externally, and let you know which one you can control and which one you can not. Then it also gives you many advices to avoid having too much desire as well as being vulgar. I should practice more of this.
