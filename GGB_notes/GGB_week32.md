**The United States in 1800**

Before United States become the No. 1 in the world, we can see how it develops in the 1800 from physical, economical conditions, and ideals. There are much fewer people in the US at that moment, and the transportation was really bad. The economics at that moment is also quite weak comparing to Europe, yet, the US has some advantages that European countries do not have. Such as little conservative power, sanguine and self-confident. This all makes the development easier. I also like what Jefferson thinks about how poeple in US will develop, i.e. until every man is potentially an athlete in body and an Aristotle in mind, how powerful is this! He holds the fith that men would improve morally with their physical and intellectual growth. Though US people loves money, it is a great incentives to make inventions and creative thinking, which also serves as the great power to move the country forward. Overall, this piece gives us a view of some interesting factors that make US the No. 1 later.

**Literature of Knowledge and Literature of Power**

An interesting classification of the literatures into two types, the one to convey knowledge, and the one to move us. The literature of knowledge may expire due to new knowledge emerging, while the literature of power, because it touches on the deeper part of our human nature, desire and emotions, it will never expire and we can learn much more from it. It also mentions that the literature of knowledge will not raise us to the next level, we are in the same leve after reading them, while the other will raise up to a different level. I totally agrees this, and will read more the literatures of power in the future.
