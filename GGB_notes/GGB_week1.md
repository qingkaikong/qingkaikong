## Week 1

> Week 1 (Feb 13-19, 2023):
* "Letter to the Reader" and "Introduction" by Robert Hutchins (GGB Vol. 1, pp. 1-108)  

I finished week 1 with excitement. To be honest, I still have places not totally understand, mostly due to English, or words that I don't know (I tried not to look these up, and only guess from the context). But as mentioned in the book, the first time, try not to stopped by these obstacles, and focus on what you understand.

**Letter to the reader**

This is a letter to the reader, which is worth reading and get you motivated on reading this set. I think it gives very good reason why we should read these great thinking books to make us a better person.    

* We spent too much time on so called fun that bought with money, supplied by gadgets, and endorsed by advertising. We are now having shorter focus spans.   
* All men by nature desire to konw - Aristotle, thus the most enduring human pleasure is the discovery
* Learning is boring due to impression that knowledge is facts and failure to adjust the different people learning pace.   
* A useful education leads to understanding and prepare for anything. Not for something that easily expired. I also think that, a good education is to train you as a independent thinker, and equip you with something that can serve you for your lifetime. Reading of these great thinkers in the past is a good way to achieve that.

**Introduction**

The introduction gives an overview of the books in this set, as well as how to read them. It starts with the different types of books included in this and GBWW sets, what they are about briefly. They ways to read different type of books are both similar and different. There are some common things you can find as well as unique methods for different types. Definitely read this part before you start to read the other volumes. 

The 2nd part of this introduction take a closer look of the 4 different types of books included here, i.e. Imaginative, Man and Society, Science and Mathematics, and Philosophy. To me, this part is more fun to read, and it gives you a framework for each type. In each one, it talks about what, why, how, development path, key objects and so on. I think this will form a systematic framework that when you read the corresponding book/selection later in other volumes, you can trace it back here to fill in this framework.
