**On the Nature of a Calculus**

There are some interesting points within this one:

* first of all, all languages are like signs
  * suggestive signs
  * expressive signs
  * substitutive signs
* in the definition of a calculus, the rules should be such that the final state of the signs after a series of operations according to rule denotes, when the signs are interpreted in terms of the things for which they are substituted, a proposition true for the things represented by the signs. This is exactly my wife and I discussed before about the math languages, because it is consistent with the logic even after many operations, therefore it can predict the future. I feel my wife is a great thinker too. 
* in talking about Equivalence, "Thus the equivalence of distinct things implies a certain defined purpose in view, a certain limitation of thought or of action". Since when we are doing the abstraction, we need to have limitations and filter out the things that can not be abstraction, such as emotional things, or sensibility. This is also why the science can not explain many things that beyond this abstraction.

**Montaigne**

A great essay to give us a peek of the famous Montaigne. He is really the pioneer of essay writting, as well as paying attention to man himself. I had a wired feeling that, all these great men in the past are due to strict family eduction, such as John Mill, and him. I also like him spending almost 10 years avoid society and reading 1500 works. I wish I could do that in the near future.

**Self-Reliance** 

I think this is really what Emerson famous for. From my knowledge before, he is the one that is closely similar to Thoreau. But reading this essay, I found that, they have somewhat similar but different philosophies towards how to live life. Thoreau is more on the practical side, and more extreme that he went to Walden and live a life all by himself. While Emerson thinks that, we need to be self-reliance, and best to live within society but be independence of solitude. This essay mostly talking about why we need to be self-reliance (or self-trust), and live in the present. Because I read some self-reliance books before, I was thinking he would talk more on the material side of self-reliance, but it turns out that he mostly talked about the mental side of self-reliance. I think this is more important, because you need to be self-reliance first in your mind before you can proceed with the material side.  

I think many of what he talked about are common things these days, though not a lot of people realize it (or at least not walk in this path). It must be a lot of shock when he first write about this and persuading people to be self-reliance and not depend on the society

There are also some very interesting ideas that I never thought of:

* our minds travel when our bodies are forced to stay at home
* Society never advances. It recedes as fast on one side as it gains on the other. Society is a wave. The wave moves onward, but the water of which it is composed does not. 
* The example of declaration of oneself to his/her father, mother ... is very interesting. 

Also, I really love this point, which is very similar to mine at this point:

* Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its memebers. Society is a join-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better securing of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and culture of the eater. The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion. 

This essay is beautifully written, when I read it, I really have a strong shaking feeling in my body, and I think I will read it more times to feel this excitement.

**Mowgli's Brothers**

Nice story, this reminds me when I was a boy, I heard a similar story of a boy raised up by wolves. It is interesting to imagine the time when the wolves first met Mowgli, as well as the law of the Jungle. It is only selected chapters here, which makes me want to read more.

**Learning the River**

Finish learning the river, it is very interesting to see how, as a pilot, do when the river rises or low, different problems, all need knowledge to go through them. It is also interesting to see two friends become enemy when a beautiful girl is there to arouse their aggressive feeling. 

But the most important thing in this part is what the pilot needs (1) a very good memory, (2) good and quick judgement and decision (3) a cool, calm courage that no peril can shake. As for the last point, the trick they did with him really is a good lesson to learn, we need to be confident with ourselves.

**Observations on Mental Education**

This is a lecture given by Farady, and it is great to see how the great mind thinks towards mental education. How many times when we make our judgement, we just based that on instinct instead of careful thinking? He thinks this is the biggest problem of our mind. He gives the steps that we should consider to practice our mind for making good judgment, such as form clear/precise idea of the problem, the assumption, the basis, and resistance to the tendency to deceive outselves regarding what we wish for, etc. 

I also think this point is very interesting: the greatest discovery a man could make would be to prove that one of these accepted laws was erroneous.
