**New Names for Old**

I like this short piece, and it has many interesting ideas, by looking of mathematics from language perspective. It is true that, math has many easy words to describe difficult concepts. 

* Mathematics is the science which uses easy words for hard ideas. 
* Mathscope is not a physical instrument, it is a purely intellectual instrument, the ever-increasing insight which mathematics gives into the fairyland which lies beyond intuition and beyond imagination. 
* It is also funny to see the Russian peasant came to Moscow for the first time when he saw the giraffes, "Look", he said, "at what the Bolsheviks have done to our horses" ^_^
* It is interesting to see the young kids treat 100 as a very large number, that is my kid does, he always thinks that's the largest number when he describes anything. 
* It is also interesting to know the word "Ggoogol" invented by a child (Dr. Kasner's 9-year-old nephew)

**The Hero as King**

This is something different than what I thought before, I had the impression that Napoleon is better than Cromwell, but he thinks the reverse. Though I am not totally sold by his arguments, I should read the history/biographies of these two men. 

Also, is the history really moved by the heros as he mentioned? I don't quite agree, I think heros do have a very large factor in the moving of the history, but there are other factors.

**The Man That Corrupted Hadleburg** 

Un-corruptable? That is because you don't have enough temptation ...
