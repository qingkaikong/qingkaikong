**The Sunless Sea**

This is a pretty good one that I learned a lot from it, also the style is very easy to read. I learned the history about the deep sea exploration and the hypothesis why they found the strange signals. It makes me want to read more and the whole book (the sea around us). I never thought about the whales were living on land before, and then gradually entered into the ocean, and we find they have degraded arms and legs. It is also interesting to see they divide their food to avoid competition, how interesting is this! I think they are even better than human beings who are competing on the same thing, we need more diverse life style to have better lives.

**The Will to Believe**

William James is one of the leaders of the utilitarianism, he starts with Pascal's claim about believing in God like gamble, and developed his theory behind it.

**The Postulates of the Science of Space**

From geometry point of view, it takes us from the very beginning to non-Euclid geometry. Nice overview!
