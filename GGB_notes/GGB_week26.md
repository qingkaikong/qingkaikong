**The Doctor in Spite of Himself**

Such a hilarious story, that the wife forced the husband to be a doctor. I think sometimes, when we forced to a character, and we really become someone. I also think the noble people in the past are so easy to deceive, you need to be confident as well as know some Latin. This story also reflects the marriage standard for the noble men at that time, similar to now. I am thinking if the young man didn't heir the money from his uncle, our doctor will be hanged, but at least he did something worth praise. Why I don't have a rich uncle ^_^

**The Way to Write History**

I like how he treat the fever of writing history as epidemic, such a great analogy. It is true sometimes people are getting fever of doing certain things, but writing history is defintely not an easy job. "Facts are not to be collected at haphazard, but with careful, laborious, repeated investigation, on the other hand, the facts are not to be recorded indiscriminately", this is so true, I think the person who can discriminate out the important facts are truth histrian. I also like his point of "my perfect historian must start with two indispensable qualifications: the one is political insight, the other the faculty of expression; the first is a gift of nature, which can never be learned; the second should have been acquired by long practice, unremitting toil, and loving study of the classics". I don't agree with the first quality that is not learnable, I think with more intented excercise, and more familiar with what should be selected, you can get a sense of this political insights.
