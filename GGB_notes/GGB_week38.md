**Perpetul Peace**

Can you think a set of rules to keep the different nations at peace with each other? This is what this article to do. It tells you the things you don't want to do which seems give you the perpetual peace but instead it only gives you a trauce. It also tells you the rules to achieve perpetual peace, such as republican state, federation of free states, and cosmopolitical rights, with the measures to guarantee it. Of course, a secreate one article where to provide an environment to listen to the philosophers before declaring wars ^_^ This is interesting. I also found that, the Democracy he mentioned has different definitions then what we know today, this confuses me when I read the part of republican and democracy, at least now I understand that Kant is against the direct democracy. Overall, this is pretty cool to read that many great ideas have been explored to build the perfect nations that can avoid wars.

**An Essay on Modern Education**

This essay mostly talks about the education for the kids from the noble families, and discusses the reasons why they don't like learning.

**A Meditation upon a Broomstick**

Such an amazing essay that the author can imagine so many things about a broomstick. I think only people have full of imaginations can see everything and link it to useful things. I am amazed that our people are like broomsticks in many ways, thanks to the author! I definitely love his essay about his resolutions when being old. Jonathan is an author with great ideas, I should read his work more.

**Of Riches**

As all the other essays by Bacon, this one is full of wise and cool statement. Don't treat riches are not useful, we still needed, but also don't pay too much attention on accomulate more, it will be a burden. Enough riches is good, and it will come slowly. Land and real resources are the true riches.
