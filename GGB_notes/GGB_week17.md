**The Study of Mathematics**

Russell thinks mathematics is pure reasoning, and has the ultimate beauty in it if we can pass the door of the palace, but many of us will turn our back after getting the door, because it is hard to get in. He also thought the education of math is not a good one, because most of the teaching didn't show the beauty but as a way to just pass the knowledge to the students to use it. 

* not only is mathematics independent of us and our thoughts, but in another sense we and the whole universe of existing things are independent of mathematics. 
* The world of reason, in a sense, controls the world of fact, but it is not at any point creative of fact, and in the application of its results to the world in time and space, its certainty and precision are lost among approximations and working hypotheses. 
* Every great study is not only an end in itself, but also a means of creating and sustaining a lofty habit of mind, and this purpose should be kept always in view throughout the teaching and learning of mathematics

**Mathematics and the Metaphysicians**

I am glad that I read the Beyond the Googol yesterday, which has a lot of overlap here with Russell's piece (also, easier to understand in the Beyond the Googol). I have better understanding of the concept of infinitesimal, infinite, and continuum, and why they are important. I am interested in seeing Russell's idea of that mathematics is a pure procedure of reasoning, a formal logic, where he pays a lot of attention on the prove of the obvious. He thinks that the obviousness is the enemy to correctness, thus the invention of the symbolism makes it not obvious, where we saw lots of shaky assumptions, as well as found new things out of the obvious. I think this is a cool idea, many of the creative ideas or great discoveries are from the obviousness. I read some of the stories about Russell and Cantor before, but I never undstand how Cantor's work is so important, and now I get it, he definitely paves the way of infinite as well as continuum in mathematics. I like this one from Russell "Great triumphs inspire great hopes; and pure thought may achieve, within our generation, such results as will place our time, in this respect, on a level with the greatest age of Greece". One thing, I didn't quite get, the title has a Metaphysicians inside, but I didn't see it too much in the essay. 

* Pure mathematics was discovered by Boole, in a work which he called the Laws of Thought
* In the first place, though poeple had talked glibly about infinity every since the beginnings of Greek thought, nobody had ever thought of asking, what is infinity?
* The most remarkable result of modern methods in mathematics is the importance of symbolic logic and of rigid formalism.

**Definition of Number**

Never thought you can spend that long to just define a familiar concept, but it is hard to define it clearly. Somehow, I don't quite like this writting.

**Beyond the Googol**

In this one, the authors also define the numbers as in Russell's piece, and this one is much clearer. It is just a one-to-one correspondence of two classes, we don't need to know exact numbers, but we can know they are the same. I can understand, and enjoy the examples it gives.For example, the even numbers are have the same number as the whole numbers. I also feel this is realy interesting to see the property of the concept of infinite, the whole is no greatere than many of its parts. With the clear definition of numbers, understanding the infinite classes are easier to understand. I am also impressed by the power of the continuum, a line one inch in length ctntains as many points as a line stretching from the earth to the most distant stars. Not only the infinite lies in space, but also in time as well. I never thought about you can compare infinite numbers, and show there are larger ones. Cantor's work are so cool. 

* mathematics serves as a tool and a language, the language of description, of number and size. 
* Counting, matching, comparing are almost as indigenous to man as his fingers. 
* How did Sir Arthur Eddington claim that there are, not approximately, but exactly 136 * $2^{256}$ protons, how do we verify this?
* To establish the science of the infinite involves the principle of mathematical induction. This principle affirms the power of reasoning by recurrence.

**The Spinoza of Market Street**

A nice and short piece to make you feel the warmth of the human relationships. I am amazed by the two worlds that saw by Dr. Fischelson, one is very ordered and quiet and the other is the opposite, who wants the noisy one? But I really feel sorry for him when he was sick, and start to feel the warmth from Dobbe, who is a pure and more un-civilized girl. I feel I start to love more and more of the un-civilized nature of the human from these stories. I am pretty sure that the last statement Dr. Fischelson made "Divine Spinoza, forgive me. I have become a fool." is just a way to accept the relationship. Sometimes people are thinking too much of the science or nature that they forget that the human relationships are one of the best thing that we can experience our lives with.
