> Week 10 (April 17 - 23, 2023, travelling): 

* "The School for Scandal" by Richard Sheridan (GGB Vol. 4, pp. 82 - 159)   
* "The Two Drovers" by Sir Walter Scott (GGB  Vol. 2, pp. 178-205) 


Since I am traveling the whole week, I only take Vol 4 with me, I spent most of my time reading only one play, it is interesting!

**The School for Scandal**

A play that initally I feel so relax to hear all the scandals, but later reveals some of the plots behind it. The two scenes, i.e. Charles sells the paintings of his ancestors and the hiding screen and closet, are so interesting and breath taking. It really drews me to read more and more and finish on the flight. It tells us that, the person usually look nice from outside view, maybe the one who is really hiding something. Since we are all humans, and we have our own balance of good and bad things. Too good a person looks like, he/she will not be a person, a god may be, but we have no god in reality, must be something being hidden.

**The Two Drovers**

How come the two friends end up with killing one and sentenced to death for another one? I do feel there are a couple of things that leading to the results, (1) the internal hostile between English and Scottish, though outside it is not clear, there is always something deep inside; (2) the pride of man or nation, and once got hurt, may take revenge enventually; (3) lack of communication and understanding between the two. This is maybe hard to really avoid. 

From this story, I also can see the people living in that time, what they do for living and how do they talk with each other. Though the Scottish English is very hard to read, you can sort of getting the ideas.
