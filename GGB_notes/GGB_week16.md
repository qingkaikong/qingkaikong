**Billy Budd**

This one is somehow hard to read, so hard that my mind kept wandering around. I did get the general plot from the story, but not many details. It does seem Billy represent the un-civilized and pure nature of human while Claggart represent the opposite side. The author prefers the un-civilized nature. It is a little unreasonable to hang Billy in my opinion, at least there are evidences to show that he was the victim at the first place. But this brings another question, what is law, and why do we follow it, does it right all the time in front of the moral? Remember the stories we read, the soldier who got shot after he saved the ship from the slipped canon, the poor drover who killed his friend due to the misunderstanding. They are all killed by some sort of law, but emotionally, we feel something is not correct. This is a hard question that even today I think is not totally and clearly explained.

**The gentleman from San Francisco**

An interesting short piece to read, I never thought the sad ending of the story. There are so many descriptions of the details, I feel there are two lines moving forward, one is the constant flow of the background of details, and the other is the gentleman. I am impressed from the beginning, that it mentioned that he was working hard to earn this 2 year trip, and start to really live, before that, he never lived for himself. This is so true for our ages as well. It is also sad to see that, when this rich man is alive, and everyone respect him, and when he died, everyone is so indifference and cold, and they are all concern the profit and themselves, and the real relationships between humans are not so kept in that time or this time.
