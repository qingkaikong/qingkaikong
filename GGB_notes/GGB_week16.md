**Billy Budd**

This one is somehow hard to read, so hard that my mind kept wandering around. I did get the general plot from the story, but not many details. The Moby Dick one I read is much better than this one in my opinion (of course, I read the Chinese version though). It does seem Billy represent the un-civilized and pure nature of human while Claggart represent the opposite side. The author prefers the un-civilized nature, which we can see from the end of the story that people are still remembering Billy. It is a little unreasonable to hang Billy in my opinion, at least there are evidences to show that he was the victim at the first place. But this brings another question, what is law, and why do we follow it, does it right all the time in front of the moral? Remember the stories we read, the soldier who got shot after he saved the ship from the slipped canon, the poor drover who killed his friend due to the misunderstanding. They are all killed by some sort of law, but emotionally, we feel something is not correct. This is a hard question that even today I think is not totally and clearly explained.

**The gentleman from San Francisco**

An interesting short piece to read, I never thought the sad ending of the story, it is so sudden. The writting style is also very interesting, there are so many descriptions of the details, I feel there are two lines moving forward, one is the constant flow of the background of details, and the other is the gentleman. I am impressed from the beginning, that it mentioned that he was working hard to earn this 2 year trip, and start to really live, before that, he never lived for himself. This is so true for our ages as well, there are so many of us that work for what we think is life, but it is actually not the life for himself. I guess this is also the reason why there is no name for this man in this piece, that we only call him "the gentleman from SF". Such a ridiculous way to let us think. It is also sad to see that, when this rich man is alive, and everyone respect him, and when he died, everyone is so indifference and cold, and they are all concern the profit and themselves, why the human relationships becomes like this? What caused these? Another struck view is that, the only nice show of human relationships on the ship, the young couple showing the intimacy of human love, were hired to perform the show. Such a wired thing, and so depressed feeling when you think about human relationships! This one really reminds me of the Death of Ivan Ilyitch I read last week, very similar plot, that a so-called successfull man that never lives his own life, but money and fame. One got re-birth before his death, because he has time to do so, the other one is so sudden, that has no time to reflect, does this count as lucky or unlucky? When the dead gentleman was shipped back to US, everything is the same, i.e. same route, same ship, same people, but everything is not the same, he can not even be put into his room!
