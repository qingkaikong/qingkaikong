**Youth**

An interesting story that takes us to the sea, I was wondering why there are so many works about the mystery sea. Anyway, this one takes us to a dangerous trip that we see the leakage of the ship, the blow up of the board, as well as the found of the ship. But we do see the brave of the seaman, and their resposibility. The youth from the story teller makes us remembering our young ages. It has so much strength when facing dangerous situations, when facing mock from others, they still stick to their own plan to achieve it, when future is uncertain, they can face it with calm and excitment, these are all youth has! No wonder it has praises like “O youth! The strength of it, the faith of it, the imagination of it!”

The ship Judea has its own character as well, no matter how old it is, how bad condition it is, it still have a clear goal to Bankok, and it has a magnificient death in the sea, much better than the ones dying in the calm bay. 

Here is one from the original:
"By all that's wonderful, it is the sea, I believe, the sea itself or is it youth alone? Who can tell? But you here you all had something out of life: money, love whatever one gets on shore and, tell me, wasn't that the best time, that time when we were young at sea; young and had nothing, on the sea that gives nothing, except hard knocks and sometimes a chance to feel your strength that only what you all regret?"

**Letter to Herodotus**

This letter shows how Epicurus thinks about the world using his elementary atom based theory, really cool, many of the ideas are correct, which can be used as basis to explan many other observations. The argument of space and bodies are infinity is also very interesting, Remember, this is more than 2000 years ago!

**Letter to Menoeceus**

This letter talk more, and he also thinks religion is superstition, but he thinks god exists, just no real functions. I also love this sentence "The right understanding of these facts enables us to refer all choice and avoidance to the health of the body and the soul's freedom from disburbance since this is the aim of the life of blessedness"

**Of Followers and Friends**

The only feeling I got after reading this one is that, dealing with people is so hard, and it is much easier to work on the things that you can control, while far away from followers and friends (only keep 1 or 2 really good ones), to me is the best.
