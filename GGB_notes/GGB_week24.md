Week 24 (July 24 - July 30, 2023):

* "Of Custom and Education" by Francis Bacon (GGB  Vol. 7, pp. 18-19)  
* "Resolutions when I Came to Be Old" by Jonathan Swift (GGB  Vol. 7, pp. 28-32) 
* "Nature" by John Stuart Mill (GGB  Vol. 10, pp. 475-508) 
* "A laboratory of the open fields" by Jean Henri Fabre (GGB  Vol. 8, pp. 94-104)


I almost read half of this set from Feb this year till now. It is fun and time demanding to do so that I delayed many other books I want to read. I sure found my reading skills are getting better, that I can understand more, and thinking more while reading. At this point, I want to slow down my reading speed to enjoy more of the gate way, but more importantly, to spend more time on the books I love to read. Since the reading of the Gateway book set, I tasted many different types of readings in the last 6 months, and found the things I really love. Thus from this week, instead of reading 100 pages per week, I will drop it to 50 pages per week, so that I can share the time with reading the things I really love. Through reading the gateway, I've already bought many other books that introduced by it, such as the Voyage of the Beagle, Madam Curie, Schupenhauer, etc. I found reading the books you love really improve my reading excitement, so life is short, why not focus on the things you love.

**Of Custom and Education**

* Men's thoughts are much according to their inclination; their discourse and speeches according to their learning and infused opinions; but their deeds are after as they have been accustomed. 
* Certainly custom is most perfect when it beginneth in young years; this we call education

**Resolutions when I Came to Be Old**

This is an really cool piece that list out all the annoying old people's characterstics, and when I grow old, I will use this list for sure. I believe if all the old man follow this list, they will all be loved.

**Nature**

Mill gave the definition of the Nature, "It either denotes the entire system of things ... or it denotes things as they would be, apart from human intervention". It is interesting to see that he thinks it is not good to follow nature, which many of others think it is good. Instead he thinks we should control and amend nature, I guess this is the start of human being start to control Nature. I also agree his point that it is a question whether the order and design of nature can afford evidence for the existence of a just and benevolent creator. There are so many cases in Nature that shows the opposite way.

**A laboratory of the open fields**

So much I can feel his happy and excitement in this short piece when he started his laboratory of the open fields. I checked his history, and this is the man that I envy so much that I hope one day I can do something like him. He bought his one acre land at age 56, I guess I did the same thing much younger than he was. But I didn't have the passion as he has. Then passion made him the happiest man on Earth, I can imagine it, and this is the best way to get happiness. I also want to read more of his work.
