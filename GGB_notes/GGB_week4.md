**Cosmic View**

I watched a short video before which is exactly the cosmic view designed here. It is really cool to see the universe from the smallest scales to the largest scales, of course, beyand that, we have no idea. 

I always think that, we may live inside a giant, just like some bacteria inside our bodies, and we never know what's the space and time outside of our known universe, and there are nested scales of the world. 

I also found, because I am fairly familiar with the big scale things, but not so familiar with the small scale stuff, so it takes me a while to search for the words and get to know them.

**My first play**

Very interesting short essay to describe his feeling for the first few plays, as well as comparing with that from the later ones (6 years later). I had some similar vivid feeling when I first watched animations (恐龙特急克塞号). It is not I just watch it, I am in it with the characters and it is the things online in dreams. Anyway, when we grow older, and learn more things and becomre more and more rational, and the emotion is gone. Is this because ration and emotion not go well with each other? I don't know. But why the curiosity and the passion are gone when we grow old, and become more knowledgable? We should try to find out our own heart, our own emotions, and the things that keep us high in spirit. Now I also understand the movie, big fish. We need imagination, which we lose when we grow older.

**Of Adversity** 
* the good things which belong to prosperity are to be wished; but the good things that belong to adversity are to be admired
* It is true greatness to have in one the frailty of a man, and the security of a God
* Certainly vitue is like precious odours, most fragrant when they are incensed or crushed; for prosperity doth best discover vice, but adversity doth best discover virtue

**Of Love**

I am suprised by what Bacon's view on Love, of course, the inordinate, wanton love. It is interesting to see "That it is impossible to love and to be wise". I guess there are some difference in the definition we used. 

* love can find entrance not only into an open heart but also into a heart well fortified, if watch be not well kept
* Nuptial love maketh mankind; friendly love perfecteth it; but wanton love corrupteth and embaseth it

**Robinson Crusoe**

Our Robinson this week did his first island travel, as well as changed his feeling that he now thinks it is a good thing for God to send him to the island. It is interesting to see how difficult it is for him to do a lot of things without proper tools or spend a lot of time to make his own version. But at the same time, the joy he had when he finally fired the pot is uncomparable. I think the modern man seldom has this joy because everything is easy to get, you just pay a few dollars to get the thing you want. I remember that when I wanted to play Chinese chess, it is only $10 to buy, but I spent a day to make the chess pieces from the branch of a tree and draw the board by myself. I had some feeling very similar to this. 

Anyway, living alone is difficult in the sense that you have to do everything by yourself, even you want to eat a bread, it is lots of work. At the same time, you made everything by yourself, which gives you a big complishment. I like his working schedule everyday, in the morning, prey to God, and then reading. Then he will go out looking for food. Due to the heat, he doesn't work in the afternoon, until the 4 hours in the evening. No need to do a 9 - 5 pm work schedule ^_^

It is also interesting to see his reflections during the first 3-4 years.

**The English Bills of Rights**

I am really impressed by the Bill of Right, I can not believe that it is written in 1689, when in China, it is just the beginning of Qing Dynasty. I am also intrigured by the history of that period, and how the King and Paliament are fighting with each other for power. The requirements made by this bill to limit the King's power really form the basis of mordern world without dictators. What really secure the Paliament from the restore of the King's power? I was also thinking why China didn't form something like this? Even in this day, we still don't see the same kind of thinking in China, this is really a pity.

**The Lantern-Bearers**

It is an interesting essay, and needs to think of many things. I think the lantern stands for the passion or goal in your mind, and it is very interesting to think that as in the dark that you have the lantern inside your coat, and then you don't fear, feel uncertain etc. I really love it. It is a little pity that this essay didn't provide how to find this lantern, I guess everyone is different. The fable inside this essay is also very interesting, and the monk enters into a forest, which this forest is a symbol of his inner world. He is attracted by the bird's singing, represents he finds something like passion that pauses his time. This is why 50 years passed outside of the forest. Very cool fable. 

I talked with my wife on this, and she doesn't like this type of essay, where things talked are more vague and you need to figure them out, and also can have different interpretation. On the contrary, I love it.
