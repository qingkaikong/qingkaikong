**Michael Faraday**

This is converted from the presentation after Faraday passed away. So I feel I was in the Hall to listen to the great presentation about this great scientist. I am amazed by Faraday's experience that from a book binder to a faculty, and I think this is an example that when you really passion about something, you always can find some solutions to difficult problems, I remember in the Alchemist, it says, if you really want something, and the whole universe will help you. 

It is also interesting to see that Faraday got a lot of inspiration from different experiments than his. He also pay attention to the things that don't agree with his expectation, this is important.

**Dream Children, a Reverie**

I was thinking that this essay will talk about the children's creativity, but it is not. It is a dream, within it, the author has a dead wife and kids who want to learn more about their great grandma. The author created a world of his own. It really makes me to think about my grandma, and things happened when I was a kid. 

**Sanity of True Genius**
 
 The discussion in this essay shows that the genius and madness people are so close, that we need the madness but under control to be a genius. I think this maybe true, because there are many stories of the genius people show madness in their lives. I think if you perfectly normal and like everyone else, then you will just be an ordinary person.

**The Art of Life** 

We all ask the same questoin, hwo do we live our life at some point. I recently asked a lot of this question by discussing with my wife, reading through the philosophy books, and contemplating my past experiences. This essay tries to answer the same question: he thinks our lives are comprised of small fragments of experiences, and the secret to have a great one is to live every fragment well, to burn each one with hard, gemlike flame, to maintain the ecstasy. Not the fruit of experience, but experience itself, is the end.

**Robinson Crusoe**

Robinson finally saved Friday, I forgot he had planed this for a long time, and finally achieved it. It is interesting to see at that moment, people want a loyalty servant, and also after the 20+ years being alone, he finally got someone to talk to. Information is very important, and from Friday, he learned a lot of the uncertainties and unknowns in the past.

**Thoreau**

I read Walden last year, and he is always someone that gives me impulse to live like him. I also got interested in self-reliance life, and hope someday I can try it out. Reading this Biography written by Emerson let me learn more of Thoreau. His free spirit, independent character, courage to live at his will, and connect to natures all facinated me. I particularly like his observation of the nature as well as his patience. By connecting with nature, we can fulfil ourselves, and move ourself with beauty and love. I also learned that he died at age 44, so young, but another thought is that, he must have a richful life than a person who lived 100 years old, but with a routine life. That's the difference, short, but wonderful.

**The Man of Destiny**

This is my first play, very interesting. I feel Shaw did a really good job to make you feel in the same room, and experience the different feelings in the conversations as well as the actions/expressions on them. I was thinking this must be really cool before TV and modern way, that people at that moment see this as we watch TV today and see some of the intereting things happen to some celebrities. 

There are also some interesting comments within the play I think worth mentioning

* I am always to be found where my enemies don't expect me
* It is fear that makes men fight; it is indifference that makes them run away; fear is the minspring of war
* people always exaggerate the value of the things they haven't got
* People are divided into low, middle and high, ...
