**Characters**

I like these small scketches that have no specific names associated with them. I feel it is very interesting to see that the rich people are doing things freely without paying too much all the rules or so-called politeness. In contrast, the poor people are paying too much attention to these things, such as not making noise when clean nose, not making sound during eating, etc. This must be that, the poor man uses external standard to define himself, while the rich people not. I found this is exactly what I had in my education when back in China, and too much standards that require you do this and don't do that, but the rich people will just simply don't care.

**The Art of Biography**

Is the biography an art or science? It is for sure more relying on facts than fictions or poetry which you can use your imagination freely. But for some cases, you do need imagination to fill in the gaps, so in this sense, it is an art. I love reading the biographies of famous people, it gives me a chance to look into their lives, as well as the good attributes they have. I always feel really motivated/inspired by them and then try their methods in my life, I think this is part of myself now.

**The Character of Socrates** 

Something different than my previous perception on Socrates when I read this piece. I never thought that Socrates was paying a lot of attention on the usefulness of learning new things, such as math is for measuring the land, astronomy is for learning the date/time as well as guiding directions. He thinks that beyond these practical applications, we shouldn't do too much research to learn God's way, and this would make the Gods not happy. 

Another thing is that, when he was sentenced to death, he accepted it calmly. Because he thought that he was old enough that, without this trial, he will die soon due to aging. So it is better to die for justice that people will remember him for what he did. He is constantly trying to use his experience/action to teach others. What a wise man! It is true that we all remember him, not the ones who decided his death.

**Civil Disobedience** 

I finally read this famous "rebel" essay by Thoreau, though I like his idea of when civil law and internal conscience conflict, we should follow our conscience, how do we know our conscience is good one? It is also interesting to see his view when he was put into prison, he thinks it is a travel, meditation, as well as a chance to learn things he didn't know before. While reading it, I was constantly thinking if I had the courage to live as what he did in Walden. 

* The government is best which governs least. 
* I came into this world, not chiefly to make this a good place to live in, but to live in it, be it good or bad. 
* the definition of a peaceable revolution 
* I perceive that, when an acorn and a chestnut fall side by side, the one does not remain inert to make way for the other, but both obey their own laws, and spring and grow and flourish as best they can, till one, perchance, overshadows and destroys the other. If a plant cannot live according to its nautre, it dies; and so a man. 
* In fact, I quietly declare war with the state, after my fashion, though I will still make what use and get what advantage of her I can, as is usual in such cases.
