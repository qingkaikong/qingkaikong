**Of Seditions and Troubles**

This one is not easy to read, because it has so many historical/mythology events, so you need to know these to understand it. But I can get the general part of this essay, it lists the causes and provide some solutions, which are very interesting. I was thinking about this, and many of the things in China are getting worse, and I really hope the leaders in China can read this, and act on it.

**On a Certain Blindness in Human Beings**

First of all, this is a great essay, that I like it a lot. I like William James' style, I had a feeling that his Principle of Psychology is difficult (mostly from the Razor's Edge that Larry was reading this one in the Lib.). But when reading this essay, I found it is easy to read, and he had a lot of examples or quotes from different works, such as novels, essays, and other things, this combination makes many concept clearer. This helps me understand the concept deeper. I checked the Principle of Psychology, it seems it is the same style, which I feel more want to read it. 

The introduction of this essay at the beginning seems not complete, it pays attention only to the human uniqueness, but not the 2nd part, which is more on how do we gain our happiness from basic things from nature. I think his style is much easier to understand than Emerson's style. The title is "On a Certain Blindness in Human Beings", what is the thing we are blindness now? It is we ignore our nature, and our inner world build up. The examples he gave us all show that we need to find a way to improve our ability to enjoy the beauty  of the nature, as well as have a good way to do nothing.

**The Energies of Men**

Again, this is different than the introduction at the beginning of the essays, I was wondering if the person who wrote it might be written this in an overview aspects that in a series of development. Anyway, in this essay, William James actually think we are all under-use our potential, which you can see that when people in certain conditions that they can release the full potential. But more interestingly is that he asked the question, how do we improve it to release our potential more often, or we can use it regularly. Thus the factors he mentioned, (1) the Excitements, ideas and efforts, (2) duty, the example of others, and crowd pressure and contagion. He also mentioned that, Yogo or meditation seems can create the ability to bring it out. I also feel really  good when I see that he thinks Biographies can individual experiences can improve as well, these are the ones I found really useful to me.

**Great Men and Their Environment**

This essay talks about the evolution from social and zoological aspects. The social evolution is a resultant of the interaction of two factors (1) the individual,  deriving his peculiar gifts from the play of physiological and infrasocial forces, but bearing all the power of initiative and origination in his hands; (2) the social environment, with its power of adopting or rejecting both him and his gifts. He even thinks the first one is very important, without which, the evolution may have problems. This reminds me of the things we are discussing these days, the difference between my own origin culture, as well as the western ones. We think that in China, we don't pay attention to the development of individuals, and think individuals should obey to the community. This is pretty bad in terms of the social evolution. I think once everyone can  develope himself, the resultant force will be really large. This may be the reason why the western civilization distinguish itself out from the Asia/African/American civilizations in the last few hundred years. Another thing link to the history book I am currently  reading, which is the private properties, freedom of the individuals formed the basis of the development of the Capitalism.

**Fingerprints**

I was thinking this is a piece to talk about fingerprints, it is actually not. It talks about the number system and how it is originated as well as evolved. The number sense from animals are really intriguring, I never thought about that to animals, particularly birds are having a basic number sense. But why mammals didn't develop the number sense is a mystery. It is also interesting to see the discussion of why in all the different civilizations, it mostly has base 10 as the system, followed by 5 and 20, which potential affecting factor was given, such as in the past people tend to use one hand for arms, and people use both hands and feet to count.

**The Empty Column**

This piece continue to gives the history of the development of mathematics beyond the number system, i.e. the numeration, abacus, the empty column, and the algorithm. It is very interesting to see the idea behind the abacus and the different development at various places, I want to get one to refresh my memory of using it when I was a kid, I remembered that, there are certain algorithms that I can follow to make nice patterns. I also never thought of the importance of the development of zeros, i.e. the empty column.

**The Seven Bridges of Königsberg**

The famous 7 bridges problems, which I learned when I was a high school student. It is interesting to see how Euler started to formulate the problems using symbols as well as turn observations into easier solutions.
