**Of the Study of History**

I never thought this essay was written to female audiences. In it, Hume gave an interesting incidance that he gave a girl he like a history book instead of the popular romance book at that time. May be this is the reason why he aimed for the female audiences. 

Anyway, there are interesting points in the essay. 
* Reading history can send you back in time to the old times, like a time machine, where you can only observe many interesting events.   
* Human life is short, so short that we can only know limited amount of things, but reading history can open the door that you can extend this life to much longer. This is what I thought for reading books, have the same effect as history.

**Autobiography**

Such a great read about Darwin, though this version is abridged version, I need to buy the complete version to read! The English is so smooth that I can not put it down. We can see that young Darwin had some nice features which actually attribute to his success later. 

* He is more of interest oriented instead of others, from very young, he started his collections of rocks/animals. Even though he tried different things, he finally chose to work on his interests. 
* At Cambridge, he made a lot of good connections/friends with the professors, which is wired in that he is only a young student. I guess it is his insights/thinking way that really connect him to the older/higher rank professors. Of course, he passion for what he loves also counted in. 
* He later becomes very enjoy observe and reasoning, which is good as well. 
* I also had an interesting idea while reading this, because I found that, none of the biggest 3 ideas in human history belong to Academia, though they all closely related to Academia. Such as Darwin, Newton (who had most of the book written during the pandemic at countryside farm), Einstein (who had his great ideas at the patent office). I was thinking why this is the case, maybe (1) less restricted by agreed concepts, more freedom to do something out of the boundaries; (2) less distracted by fames, funding and so on; (3) but they all have close relationship to Academia that they can get a lot of support from. Isn't this interesting?
* Another interesting thing he mentioned is that, he was fun of music, pictures and poetry when he was young, but when he practiced his mind more and more in science, he starts to lose the interest in these, though he still very interested in history, philosophy, etc. His mind seems more tuned into natural science. 
* There is an interesting comment that a rule of thumb if a work will last long is to see if it is be translated into different languages. He thinks his will last longer because his works were translated. Thus he recorded down his mind and qualities in the case that future generation wants to learn more. This is so good that I can read this after more than 150 years. 
* He mentioned that, the most efficient way to write he later found is to write freely without too much thinking, and then correct or finetune later. This is really similar to what Fan told me to do. 
* From his descriptions of his quality of mind, it seems he is a common man, but he indeed has some very good habits or qualities that make him success: the passion/love for science, he attributes this as the most important one, and he loves to collect facts and then generalize the laws behind it, this gives him the most enjoyment! 
* He also seems not care about fame and originality in the process of writting the Origins (Wallace publish a similar idea earlier), but he just do what he loves. His work is easy to read, as well as relatively short that can penetrate more people, which makes the biggest influence.

**The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde** 

I was thinking to read this one for a long time, since my daughter read it a few months ago, and we were discussing about how a person can have two sides of personality and how to control them. The story is different than I was thinking in terms of how it unfolded, it starts with the lawyer (main character) with his friend and start to talking about one wired thing during walking. Then mostly from the lawyer's perspective to try to help his client Dr. Jekyll, and found some mysteries, which revealed in the end by the confess letter from Dr. Jekyll. Overall it is fun to read this one and does make me think. It is also interesting to see that, Dr. Jekyll in the end can not make the portion that convert him back, because the success of the portion was due to the impurity of the salt he bought, which had an uncertainty that he can not recover. How ironic! The other interesting thing in the story is that, Mr Hyde is short in figure, which is because he is less practiced. But I was thinking how this personality, which lack of practice in the end is taking in charge, and make him always convert into this bad personality. I think there are some bad personality within him actually stronger than he thought, which may expain this. Fan and I talked about this, and we think that the more you suppress one personality or something, the stronger it may comes back at you some day. There are many things in life like this, for example, if you feel depressed, the best way is to try to find out the reason and release it instead of suppress it, which will accomulate more and cause harm to you in the future. Society is the same, for human nature, if you supprese it more, it may come back at unexpected time.
