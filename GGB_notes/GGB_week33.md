**Space**

Interesting to see the link of the Non-Euclid geometry to the Euclid geometry. From the premises of the Euclid geometry, one of them has problem that Bolyai-Lobachevski assume his theory is correct, expecting to develop contradiction, but no contradition to the Euclid geometry, thus one branch of the Non-Euclid geometry is established. Then Riemann developed a different one, but later it turns out that the two different approaches ara linked together, really cool. Then the author talks more about the nature of the axioms, and concluded that they are just conventions and is chosen bsed on convenience. This is really interesting, many of our theories are based on convenience, are they really truth? I guess this will be a hot endless topic. This also reminds me that the development of scientific theories are always like this, that the some theories are shown later is just special case of some other more general theories, such as Newton's law and Relativity. The 2nd part of the essay is difficult to understand, at least for me. But I think the interesting part of the geometric and perceptual space makes me think a lot.

**Mathematical Creation**

This is one of the best from the essays here. Poincaré discussed what is mathematical creation, which is choose the optimal combination from infinite options (so you need to be really good to identify the wrong ones and eliminate them). Then he gaves his own exerience of making some creations, and it is three stage, the first one is preliminary conscious stage, where you usually stuck for a long time. The second, the unconscious stage, when you stop thinking about it and try to do some other things, all of a sudden, your unconsciousness will work on it and provide you the solution. Of course, it is a myth that why the unconscious provide the solution instead of the rest of the tries. The last stage will be another conscious stage where you can finalize it. He also discussed each stage, I think very interesting, such as the unconsious stage, which it can ignore the laws, rules and other constraints that usually stop us in the conscious stage to get the results, thus it can try different directions (or all the directions). I think this is not only for the mathematical creation, but any type of creation that we want to do. This is also means the current AI or machine learning can not do the creative things, because it is still mostly relying on our human knowledge to mimic the park we know, but the unconsciousness part, it never models accurately.

**Chance**

Starts with a discussion what's chance, it discusses many different examples showing the nature of the chance. If everything has a cause, is chance merely due to we don't  know the cause (now)? Or chance is something that completely without cause? It is interesting to see the two types, which is small changes in cause leads to large changes in the consequences, and large changes in cause, but small changes in results. If we know both the initil condition, as well as every factor in universe, we should be able to determine everything, right? Or can we?
