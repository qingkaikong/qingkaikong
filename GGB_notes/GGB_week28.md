**Measurement**

I am really impressed by this essay how he starts it with the measurement, and spend so long on the topic. The rules/requirements he raised is very interesting that I never thought about it before. But the examples given in it really make the concepts clear.

**Numerical Laws and the Use of Mathematics in Science**

This is a good one that can read more about how the numerical laws are developed and how the theories are developed. I think it will be useful for folks in science.

**An Idealist's Arraignment of the Age**

People at that time is the same as ours, they think a lot about the influence that caused by the newly developed technology or science. I can see how he against the industrial products, and over-consume culture, which is very similar to now. But I think he wants to go back to the middle age (if i understand correctly) is not a good thinking. In the end, he wants to have a small part of England that can have no technology contamination, which sounds pretty difficult to me. One thing is that, technology indeed gave us a lot of good things instead of only bad things, it is hard for people to go back to the independent life that described in the essay. I like what he mentioned that we need air, water, and earth as our physical requirements, and admairation, hope and love as our spiritual need. This is good classification, and I think we do need these! This is also to say, air, water and earth, we only need these to survival on the Earth.
