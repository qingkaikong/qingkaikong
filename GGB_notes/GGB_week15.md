**The death of Ivan Ilyitch**

The best one in my opinion from the 3 pieces I am reading this week. This is my second time to read this story (two years ago I read the Chinese version). It gives us a chance to exprience the death which we may all experience with ourselves only once. This experience with Ivan, we can see how other people are reacting, how our cloest relatives react, as well as how we reflect our own lives. Other people generally don't care about Ivan, but the death of him affect their own lives, such as who will replace his position, etc. It is also sad to see that, Ivan's relatives mostly pays attention on his finiancial part, not him. They even feel troublesome in the end about his dying, and the death of him is more a release for them. When Ivan reflected back how his life, and he finally realize that he never lives his life after the childhood, and he was more trying to get higher positions, earn more money, and what the higher rank people think about him etc. Even his marriage is not based on love, but it seems a tradition in the higher rank community to marry, and it is good for him to be in that community. He finally realize that his life went downhill instead of uphill as he always thinks ever since his childhood. There are a few things I think ridiculous:

* if you think carefully, his death is caused by his seeking of the high ranking. He fell off during the decoration according to rich people.  
* before his death, he finally realized that, he didn't live his life for himself, and mostly for others. All the things he thought important before were not important anymore before his death.   
* the only one who really cares about him, and comfort him is his servant.  
* do you want to live a life like his?

**The three hermits**

A short story about we should believe in God. Even these hermites in the isolated island, they still need the belif. They even need to chase the ship just because they forgot how to pray.

**What men live by** 

What a teaching piece to teach people how to live their lives, i.e. believe in God, and show your love. It is interesting to see how large the religion in people's life at that moment. I was supprised to see that Tolstoy thought this one is his best work, of course at that moment with very specific condition. It is less connecting to the current society. This is because it gives a very clear solution to the problem it poses "how should we live our lives?". It is much better if it is an open question, such as in War and Peace, or Kafka's work. These are more easy to connect with our own problems or the current problems.
