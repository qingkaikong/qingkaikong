This week, I continue to read different types. But I decide to have more short essays from Francis Bacon. 

---
I found the reading of these essays are not so easy as the other ones, and it is very abstract and hard to understand. I have to find the Chinese translation to really get more out of it. 

**Of Truth**

* It is a pleasure to stand upon the shore, and see ships tossed upon the sea; a pleasure to stand in the window of a castle, and to see a battle and the adventures thereof below; but no pleasure is comparable to the standing upon the vantage ground of truth (a hill not to be commanded, and where the air is always clear and serene), and to see the errors, and wanderings, and mists, and temests, in the vale below. 

**Of Death**

* Men fear death as children fear to go in the dark; and as that natural fear in children is increased with tales, so is the other.

**Mathematics, in Life and Thought**

This is different from the one I read last week, mostly from the physics, electric engineering, astronomy to show how useful math is. I am fairly familiar with the content. I really like the Mercury example given related to the Einstein's relativity, it is so clear about the difference between Newton's absolutness of time and space and Einstein's relative ones. It is also saying that math is more represent the progressive of the human civilization. While reading this, I think that, it is true, that the math developed recently, is much more progress than that in the past, but the human nature side, it is almost fixed or not change too much. This is something really interesting, maybe we can think this way, the tools we are using are getting newer, while the person who use them are not changing too much.

Bacon's writing, once you get familiar with it, is very beautiful and has many of the famous sayings that used today. I don't think I need to say too much, just see the followings. 

**Of Beauty** 
* Virtue is like a rich stone, best plain set   
* Beauty is as summer fruits, which are easy to corrupt, and can not last   

**Of Discourse**
* He that questions much shall learn much, and content much
* Speech of a man's self ought to be seldom, and well chosen
* A good continued sppech, without a good speech of interlocution, shows slowness; and a good reply or second speech, without a good settled speech, shows shallowness and weakness

**Of studies"**
* Studies serve for delight, for ornament, and for ability. Their chief use for delight is in privateness and retiring; for ornament, is in discourse; and for ability, in the judgment and disposition of business
* They perfect nature, and are perfected by experience: for natural abilities are like natural plants, that need pruning by study; and studies themselves do give forth directions too much at large, except they be bounded in by experience
* Crafty men contemn studies, simple men admire them, and wise men use them
* Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested
* Reading makes a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man
* Histories make men wise; poets witty; the mathematics subtile; natural philosophy deep; moral grave; logic and rhetoric able to contend
*

**Robinson Crusoe**

One of my favorite story since I was a kid, and I just read the whole book in Chinese last year. So it is relatively easy to re-read part of it. 

It is very interesting to see how Robinson determined to go out to the sea for adventure even there are so many resistance, from his father, from some signs, initial difficulties. But he still takes this path, I guess when you really have the passion for something, you will do it. 

I also always think how lucky he is to be sent to an island that has no other people, no beasts, with water and food. In addition, the founded ship also provided him a lot of things that he can use for a long time. Sometimes, I think it would be better to have another person to at least discuss things, exchange ideas, better to be a girl ^_^ In many times, I was thinking what should I do if I were him on the island.

**Childhood and Youth part2**

I continue with John Mill's autobiography. It talks a lot about religion, education, travel as well as exchange ideas with folks (famous). I think there are some interesting things struck me most:
* his father doesn't believe in God, because he thinks that, with all the evil in this world, it is hard to believe this is designed by someone who is mighty and all good. This contradiction is usually blinded by people.  
* travel after reading a lot of books help you to appreciate more 
* exchange ideas with people with great thinkings can help you a lot. But remember, only when you are an interesting soul that can attract interesting souls. 
* His father likes stoic, similar to me ^)^
* After reading the whole first 3 chapters, it is hard to say that this type of education is good for children or not, it left me with some impression that his education/job are all designed by his father, I know later he must change this, and became a famous person. But I think there must be very few one can be as lucky as he was, most of the kids go through this type may not success.

**Of Parents and Children**

* the joys of parents are secret; and so are their griefs and fears

**Of Marriage and Single life**

* wives are young men's mistresses; companions for middle age; and old men's nurses
