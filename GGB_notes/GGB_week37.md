**Probability**

It is interesting to first see the life experience of Laplace, and it says that Laplace didn't give other people credit, and also changes his political standings to obtain his stable life. Everyone seems critizing him, but I have different thinking. I think he was so focused by his own interests, that he didn't pay attention to any other things and what other people thinking, as long as he can do his own research, he is fine. He is really clever, otherwise, we won't see his books. 

For this assey, Laplace gives the basic principles of probability, and each with some examples for easy understanding. It mentioned the Principle of Sufficient Reason, which reminds me the Fourfold Roots of it by Scopenhauer I recently read. It makes me think if everything has causes or there exists something truely random? I don't know, I think this may never be answered.

**The Red and the Black**

Comparing to the essay, I am more interested in Mr. Peirce's experience as a child, when he was forced by his father to learn all the things. Though he is a great thinker later, this experience seems affect his life so much that he lived an unhappiness and chaotic life afterwards. He did find a good job that can allow him do what he wants in his spare time, I think, this is one fortunate thing in his life.
