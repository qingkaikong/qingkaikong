**The Process of Thought**

It is good to learn more of the process of our thought, because we are using it all the time. Like mentioned in this piece, "the person who understands what the better ways of thinking are and why they are better can, if he will, change his own personal ways until they become more effective". I found the section titles/subtitles are pretty good summary of the content, so I will record down these:

### What is thinking? 
* Different meanings of thought
  * the Stream of Consciousness
  * Reflective Thought is a Chain
  * Thinking usually restricted to things not directly perceived
  * Reflective thinking aims at a conclusion
  * Thinking as practically synonymous with believing
  * Reflective thinking impels to inquiry
* The central factor in thinking
  * The suggestion of something not observed
  * The function of signifying
  * Refection implies belief on evidence 
* Phases of reflective thinking
  * The importance of uncertainty and of inquiry
  * The regulation of thinking by its purpose

### Why reflective thinking must be an educational aim
* The values of thinking
  * It makes possible action with a conscious aim
  * It makes possible systematic preparations and inventions
  * It enriches things with meanings
  * Control and enriched value
* Tendencies needing constant regulation
  * Physical and social sanctions of correct thinking
  * Superstition is as natural as science
  * The general causes of bad thinking: Bacon's Idols
  * Locke on typical forms of wrong belief
  * Importance of attitudes
  * The union of attitude and skilled method
    * Open-mindedness
    * Wholeheartedness
    * Responsibility
  * The bearing of these personal attitudes upon readiness to think

### Analysis of reflective thinking
* Facts and ideas
  * Refection includes observation
  * Reflection includes suggestions
  * Data and ideas are correlative and indispensable factors in reflection
* The essential functions of reflective activity
  * Five phases or aspects of reflective thought
    * suggestion
    * intellectuallization
    * the guiding idea, hypothesis
    * reasoning
    * testing the hypothesis by action
  * The sequence of the five phases is not fixed
  * One phase may be expanded
  * Reference to the future and to the past
### The place of judgement in reflective activity
* Three factors in judging
  * Judgments, the constituent units of thought
  * the features of judgment
  * It arises from doubt and controversy
  * It defines the issue by selection evidential facts and appropriate principles
* Analysis and synthesis: the two functions of judgment
  * Mental analysis is not like physical division
  * Conscious method and unconscious logical attitude
  * Analysis and synthesis in educational procedure

### Understanding: ideas and meanings
* Ideas as suggestions and conjectures
  * Ideas are elements in judgments, tools of interpretation
  * Ideas are logical instruments, not psychic compounds
* Things and meanings
  * To understand is to grasp meaning
  * Interaction of two modes of understanding
  * Intellectual progress a rhythm 
* The process by which things acquire meaning
  * Vague wholes are antecedent to understanding
  * Practical responses clarify the vague
  * Illustrations from drawing and language
  * Meaning and context
  * The means-consequence relation and its educational significance

### Understanding: Conception and Definition
* The nature of conceptions
  * They are established meanings
  * They enable us to generalize
  * They standardize our knowledge
  * They help identify the unknown and supplement the sensibly present
  * The educational significance of concepts 
* How conceptions  arise
  * They are not formed by extracing common traits from ready-made objects
  * They begin with experiences
  * They become more definite wi*th use
  * They  become general with use
* Definition and organization of meanings
  * The harmful consequences of vagueness
  * Meaning as intension and as  extension
  * Three types of definitions
    * denotative
    * expository
    * scientific

**The Lifted Veil**

A science fiction, and there are some interesting points here. 

* If you have the ability to see the future, do you use it? I am supprised by him not using the ability and he even kind of hate this ability. He still does a lot of reading, and he also spent his time without working or doing other things. I was thinking whether this is due to he sees through his life, especially how he will die. 
* Maybe the person you love most, is the most difficult to see the nature. 
* Is human natures changing over time or certain cases? For Bertha, does she always have this dark side within her, or gradually gained that due to various things happened to her?
* The end of the story is
