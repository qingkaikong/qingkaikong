**The Sphinx**

Such an interesting small piece, though I think he may overthinking ^_^ I like the two branches of sciences, i.e. the one study all things and the one study man. He thinks the science is like Sphinx, has many faces. But I didn't quite see the two branches of sciences from the riddle or there are only weak links. It is interesting to see that when the Sphinx dead, its heads were on its ass, which indicate that once the science is published or discovered, even the dull head can carry it.

**Geological Evolution**

The author raises the question that Geology isn't just conjecture, you need to combine the evidences to the conjectures. He also mentioned that, Geology can not raise to the rank of other sciences, since many things are not experimentable, and logic is the string to connect all the dots. This reminds me of the movie Big Bang Theory, that in one of the paint ball games, Sheldon shouted Geology isn't a real Science when he decided to die in the game ^_^ Anyway, this book principle of geology is the first one in the field, and a great work since it expands the time of our Earth, just like Columbus expands the spatial dimension of our Earth. Before this book, people thinks that the world just started a few thousands years ago, thus it will ends in another few thousands, but this book almost expands the life of our Earth to a far far distant future.

**The Rise and Decline of Classical Physics**

It is interesting to see Einstein uses the detective stories as an analogy to scientific discovery, i.e. we need to gother the clues and infer the law or nature behind these phenomenons. One particular thing I think very interesting is that, many of the foundamental laws are results from pure idealized mind experiment. Such as Aristotle thinks we need force to keep the mass moving because he observed that we need to use more forces to push things forward. But Galileo from the observation that the smoother the contact plane, the further the object moves, he extended this thought experiement to extreme if there is no friction, things will move uniformly forever. This thought experiement led to the foundamental law of movement. Same for Newton and Albert Einstein, all derived from thought experiments instead of direct observations, though some of the observations are used to verify the correctness of the derived laws. The discussion of inertial mass and gravitational mass is also very interesting, is there really some world that these two are different? What if these two masses are different? The concepts of heat, temperature and specific heat are also worth discussion, and if we really pay attention, we found how we define them to make the discussion accurate as well as logically consistent that we can predict or infer more complicated things. 

To see the decline of the classic physics, the development difficulties in using the mechanical view to explain electron flows, induced magnetic forces, as well as the nature of the light all start to shake the foundation of the classic physics. There are also very interesting views on the development of science that I really like: The formulation of a problem is often more essential than its solution, which may be merely a matter of mathematical or experiment skill. To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old problems from a new angle, requires creative imagination and marks real advance in science. 

Another thing I realized is that, some of the terminology in Chinese, when translated loses its connections, because when I read the English version about the light theories, I found that, the transverse and longitutional waves are so connected to the P and S waves, but in Chinese, you can not see any connection.

**On Education**

This is one of the best essay I read recently, and I alwasy thought Schopenhauer's work is difficult to read (I don't know where I had this impression), but it is not at all. I guess this is something reflect the content of this essay, I need to form my abstract idea from experience instead of what others told me ^_^ The two methods raised by him is exactly what I talked with my daughter yesterday, and I was talking with her to pay attention to her experience instead of the ideas or concept given by others, even her parents. But I never thought details of it like Schopenhauer. These key ideas are worth reading again and again

* the natural method of education is: the general ideas arise by abstraction from particular observations, and therefore come after them in point of time
* The bad thing about the artificial education, which teaches you first the general ideas from others without connecting it to experience/observations, is that, it will bias your view of the world, and root into your system that hard to unlearn or correct. This is exactly I feel when I am in US now. 
* from the discussion, it makes me think that when we were kids to learn language, if my parents only told me apple without showing me one, how difficult it is to get the connection
* A man sees a great many things whne he looks at the world for himself, and he sees them from many sides, but this method of learning is not nearly so short or so quick as the method which employs abstract ideas and makes hasty generalizations about everything. This is so true, that we should allow slow experiment, and trial and error from the kids. 
* It also reminds me that, many things I learned when I were a kids, such as loyalty, love of the country back in China is one of this artificial learning, it just squeeze in my mind that, now I need to unlearn of it. 
*  He thinks that no children under age of 15 should receive instruction in sugjects which may possibly be the vehicle of serious error, such as philosophy, religion, or any other branch of knowledge where it is necessary to take large views. But subjects where no error is possible at all, such as mathematics, or to those in which there is no particular danger in making a mistake, such as languages, natural science, history and so on is fine to teach them. 
* He also thinks that memory should be specially taxed in youth, since it is then that it is strongest and most tenacious. It is all important to fill the memory with what is essential and material in any branch of knowledge, to the exclusion of everything else. 
* A man's knowledge may be said to be mature, in other words, to have reached hte most complete state of perfection to which he, as an individual, is capable of bringing it, when an exact correspondence is established between the whole of his abstract ideas and the things he has actually percieved for himself. 
* novel reading is another issue, since he thinks the novles represent a state of things in life and the world such as, in fact, does not exist, so we need be careful what the youth to read it. 

I plan to read more works from Schopenhauer.

**Of Great Place**

The ones really echos are:

* So as they have no freedom, neither in their persons, nor in their actions, nor in their times. It is a strange desire, to seek power and to lose liberty; or seek power over others and to lose power over a man's self. 
* The rising unto place is laborious, and by pains men come to greater pains
* When you are not what you were, there is no reason for you to wish to live longer
* Certainly great persons had need to borrow other men's opinions to think themselves happy; for if they judge by their own feeling, they can not find it. 
* Certainly man in great fortunes are strangers to themselves, and while they are in the puzzle of business they have no time to tend their health either of body or mind
